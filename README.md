# color-labs
Color Science Labs, Fall 2023. :)

To steup (as I understand Github):
1. Download Github desktop
2. Sign in and such
3. Set repository of 'color-labs' to somewhere on your PC
4. Clone respository onto your PC
5. Open MATLAB into a file within repository
6. Add "color-labs" and all subsidiary folders to PATH (There's a button for that within the "Add path" menu)

To push:
1. Within "Project#" folder, click the green circle to add that item to be committed. Should look like a plus sign now.
2. Either a) Go to Github desktop, veryify and push or b) Commit within MATLAB by right clicking the file explorer menu on the left-hand side and "Manage sources"


IDK if any of this is factual, haven't actually tried to do this :P
